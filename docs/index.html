        <blockquote>
            Instrument hundreds of feature flags daily.<br/>
            Run hundreds of A/B experiments concurrently.

        <p>
        Variant is a robust, high performance middleware for managing <em>code variations</em>, which, typically, come
        in the form of A/B tests or feature flags. Architected as client/server middleware, Variant is tightly
        integrated with the host application's runtime and its operational data. Variant is particularly attractive to
        distributed and cloud-native host applications.

        <h5>Simple Example</h5>

        <h4>Server Side</h4>

        <p>
        Suppose your existing application offers two pricing tiers, Free and Pro, and you would like to experiment with a three-tier
        pricing by offering an additional ProPlus tier. Let's further suppose that the pages where this experiment is relevant are
        Plans and Upgrade. All these semantics are conveniently encapsulated by the Variant variation schema on the right.
        Simply drop this schema in the server's <code>/schemata</code> directory and Variant is ready to send one in 500 sessions into
        the experiment.
