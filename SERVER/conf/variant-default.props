# User session is discarded by the next run of the session vacuum thread, but not
# sooner that this many seconds:
#session.timeout.secs = 900

# Session vacuum thread runs every this many seconds:
#session.store.vacuum.interval.secs = 10 

# Default event flusher appends events to the server log. See documentation for
# other available event flushers or how to write and configure a custom implementation:
#event.flusher.class.name = com.variant.core.event.EventFlusherAppLogger
#event.flusher.class.init = {}

# Asynchronous event writer holds at most this many events in a memory buffer:
#event.writer.buffer.size = 20000
# and will wake up when the buffer is at least this percent full:
#event.writer.percent.full = 50
# but no less frequently than this many milliseconds:
#event.writer.max.delay.millis = 30000
